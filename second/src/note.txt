Creating LIST 
1//React always asks for id on creating a list
this is because react needs to identify each rendered item, 
when item need to be added, changed or removed. 

Setting index as a unique Identity is not at all a preferred way, because the moment the item
is added or value is changed, the index may refer to a different entity.
2//React prefers id or key ot be of String. 
 
3// Should you use the index of map() method as key attribute?
No=> key: must have stable identity. Its better to assign stable id, eg that can be from database,
