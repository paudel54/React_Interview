Creating LIST 
1//React always asks for id on creating a list
this is because react needs to identify each rendered item, 
when item need to be added, changed or removed. 

Setting index as a unique Identity is not at all a preferred way, because the moment the item
is added or value is changed, the index may refer to a different entity.
2//React prefers id or key ot be of String. 
 
3// Should you use the index of map() method as key attribute?
No=> key: must have stable identity. Its better to assign stable id, eg that can be from database,  

4// what would be teh defalut value of attrribute
=>TRUE <DemoComponent value/>


5//Use of Spread Operator:
passing attribute with the Spread Operator is a fantastic short way when you are willing to pass object to props. 

6.//React Fragmants:
allows up to wrap children without adding extra notes to the DOM.

7.//Event Handling with inputs, checkbox,text inputs, forms!!
 {/* on passing parameter on events like onCLick={()=>functionWithParameters()} or args we need to have a fuction with return so it prevents on load behaviour.  */}
 //Synthetic Events (e)
 e.target means we are going to get the reference of the element which raised the event. 
 What is Synthetic Events.||> A syntheticEvent is a wrapper around the native browser event object and that is passed to every function automatically
 //ITS automatically Received. Reference of event received as each
 8. Write a code to get content of divison. 
 Create a div with onClick handler and console.log('Content of div', e.target.innerHTML)

9. Input Events!
    event handler: onChange={getChange} e.target.value
    How do you update text input on react?
    => SyntheticEvent (e.target.value) has reference to that element from which we can update the state and Render to InterFace. 

9.Preventing Default behaviour on form Submit. 
    How will you prevent the default behaviour of an element?
    can you use return false ? no not in react
    we use e.preventDefault() explicetly. 

10.! When you try to update Object Literal, you have to make sure that the previous/existing value is there & then you update the new value
How will you update the individual value of state inside an object?
// updating individual value of state inside an object by the use of Spread operator

11. Can you directly render object?
object are not valid react child we need to convert into String with JSON.Stringify

12.Improvising handlers, single handlers for all inputs or state
introduction to square [] to haold variable
let test = "ename";
const obj = {
    [test]: 'Name'
}
 
 Here Key of an object hold on Variable Name
 //implementaion of dynamic keys and single change handlers. 

 13. Why is updating state with "functional update" syntax better?
   const handleChange = (e) => {
    //  better apporcah with use of previous state
    // setPersonInfo({ ...personInfo, [e.target.name]: e.target.value })
    setPersonInfo((prevState) => {
      return { ...prevState, [e.target.name]: e.target.value }
    });
  }

!!=> React doesnot update the state immediately as it has its own method or schedule to update the state
INcase there are many updates of state happening at same time, it may refers to incorrect copy of state
functional update makes sure we have latest copy of the state. 

14.// Checkbox or Radio -Input Feild
Dropdown button =>value Property
Textboxes => value Property
Checkbox/radioButon =>Checked Property

15.// What is  Conditional Rendering. => Showing Specific components depending on Specific Condition. 
Depending upon user Interface Changes: realworld exmp: dashboard switch ADMIN vs USER. 
using if..else swithc..case.. ternary Operator ( condition ? true: false) logical &&

16. Explain the JSX element variable syntax and concept. 

const prodItems = (items.map((item)=>{
  return (
    <li>{item.pName}</li>
  )
}))

17.  Logical && 
{condition if true && renders HTML elements}
