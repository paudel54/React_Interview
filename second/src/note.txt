Creating LIST 
1//React always asks for id on creating a list
this is because react needs to identify each rendered item, 
when item need to be added, changed or removed. 

Setting index as a unique Identity is not at all a preferred way, because the moment the item
is added or value is changed, the index may refer to a different entity.
2//React prefers id or key ot be of String. 
 
3// Should you use the index of map() method as key attribute?
No=> key: must have stable identity. Its better to assign stable id, eg that can be from database,  

4// what would be teh defalut value of attrribute
=>TRUE <DemoComponent value/>


5//Use of Spread Operator:
passing attribute with the Spread Operator is a fantastic short way when you are willing to pass object to props. 

6.//React Fragmants:
allows up to wrap children without adding extra notes to the DOM.

7.//Event Handling with inputs, checkbox,text inputs, forms!!
 {/* on passing parameter on events like onCLick={()=>functionWithParameters()} or args we need to have a fuction with return so it prevents on load behaviour.  */}
 //Synthetic Events (e)
 e.target means we are going to get the reference of the element which raised the event. 
 What is Synthetic Events.||> A syntheticEvent is a wrapper around the native browser event object and that is passed to every function automatically
 //ITS automatically Received. Reference of event received as each
 8. Write a code to get content of divison. 
 Create a div with onClick handler and console.log('Content of div', e.target.innerHTML)
