1. JS have var and let to declare variables and const to decalre constant
    It is same in TypeScript.
                but 
    In JS we dont have a choice to 
    explicitely decide the datatype. 
In typescript we have that choice. 


2. Expain the syntax of declaring a TypeScript variable.  
      let variableName:datatype;
      const variabename:datatype;
      var variablename:datatype;
    ex1: let person:string = 'paudel';
    ex2: const prime:number = 7;

3. Is there any convention or rule to follow while declaring a variable?
    a. variable can't start with number.
    b. variable should not have space but use underscore.
    c. variable can contain alphabet or a number.
